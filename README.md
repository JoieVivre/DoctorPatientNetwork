This project represents my contributions to a group project for CS 315-Modern Database Management in May 2018. I created the html landing page, the JavaScript clicking functions associated with buttons, and the corresponding PHP pages to transfer information to and from the SQL server. This project was a final requirement for successful completion of the class.

Contributions from others are not neccessary at this point as this represents my individual efforts to showcase my coding abilities. I maintain/contribute to this project individually and any possible future contributors would be chosen by me.
